# Components-code-style-standard
Components code style standard - A standard to name models, methods, events and behaviours.
Applicable for any reactable code mostly based on libraries applying components.

### Why this
Everyone has their own way to code or name their functions/methods. That makes it difficult to follow/understand the internal code of a component if you and the creator follow a different convention. That can be even more confusing if you want to use their component.
Let's finish this. Let's all follow the same standard.
