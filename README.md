# Components-code-style-standard
Name properties/attributes, methods, events and behaviours as the comunity dose.
Applicable for any library/framework based on components.

## Why this
Everyone has their own way to code or name their functions/methods. That makes it difficult to follow/understand the internal code of a component if you and the creator follow different conventions to organise the code, name the methods, events... 

That can be even more confusing if you want to modify their component.

Let's end up with this problem with this standard.
